Getting sun in your eyes while travelling gets annoying, so this tool lets you pick a route and see which side gets the most sun.

Uses Open Street Maps and [SunCalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) to determine the side (left or right) that recieves the least sun over the journey. This is then shown on a map, highlighting areas in red which would still receive sun.

Feel free to create an [issue](https://github.com/Cimera42/SunnySide/issues) suggesting any changes.
